title: "Final Year Project: Data Visualizations for KPI Management"
---

During my time at **Temasek Polytechnic**, I worked on a **data visualizations project** for my internship company, focusing on their **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**. This project was pivotal in improving the efficiency of their reporting and decision-making processes.

## Key Objectives:
- Develop an intuitive and interactive dashboard to visualize company KPIs.
- Automate the data pipeline to minimize the need for manual data cleaning and preparation.

## My Contributions:
Using **Tableau**, I created multiple graphs and visualizations, such as:
- **Trend Analysis**: To monitor performance over time.
- **Pie Charts**: To display resource allocation across departments.
- **Bar Graphs**: For comparative analysis of sales performance.

In addition to visualization, I streamlined the data preparation process, ensuring the dashboards could automatically update with minimal intervention. This automation saved the company significant time and effort.

## Learning Outcomes:
This project enhanced my understanding of:
- How companies use KPIs to manage and evaluate their projects.
- The importance of efficient data cleaning and preparation in analytics.
- Advanced techniques in **data visualization** and **dashboard design**.

Overall, the experience significantly improved my technical skills and provided practical insights into data-driven decision-making in a corporate environment.
